\paragraph{Big O Notation} describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends toward infinity.
\label{supp::big_o}
For example, the leading term ($3 x^4$) in the polynomial $p(x) = 3 x^4 + 20 x^2 + 1$, represents the strongest factor that determines the behaviour of the function. As such, we say $p$ has order $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$. Note that we drop any constant multiplier as it doesn't modify the growth or shape of the function.
