\subsection{Nuclear Spin Mapping Fidelity}
\todo[inline]{Discuss all results related to nuclear spin mapping}

	As discussed earlier\todo{cite section}, nuclear spin mapping was used to improve the readout fidelity of our experiment. However, the improvement in fidelity was conditional upon the initial state of the electron at the time of the mapping. To perform correct mapping, a spin-down electron is required. Figure \ref{fig::wait_time} shows the total experimental error as a function of steering time. As steering time increases, we are more confident that the state of the electron was spin-down at the time of mapping, which is reflected in our decrease in error. The average time spent in the initialisation period is plotted on the right-axis. This would exceed the steering time in the average case, as a blip in current would require postponement of the donor plunge.

	\end{figure}
	
	There are 2 separate data sets plotted, one for $B = 1.4$ T and the other for $B = 1$ T. These two datasets show the relationship between the required steering time for a good initialisation and the apparent tunnelling time of the donor electron. The required steering time to achieve 99\% fidelity is much longer for $B = 1$ T, however it was observed that the average tunnel time had not increased by such a margin from $B = 1.4$ T. This could be explained if we accept that the probability of a spin-down electron tunnelling off during the initialisation phase is high (also known as a dark-count), which is equivalent to a read-error. Whilst this is a possible explanation, it's not clear if this is accurate, and more examination of the data is required.

\subsection{Nuclear and Electron Rabi Oscillations}
	\todo[inline]{Discuss results pertaining to a high fidelity readout from a nuclear/electron rabi}
	Figure \ref{fig::nuclear_rabi} show a demonstration of the improvement that can be achieved using this initialisation scheme.
	
	The generic nuclear Rabi oscillation was performed by loading an electron onto the donor, followed my mapping the state onto the nucleus. This electron is ideally spin-down for this step. After the nucleus is prepared, we stimulate it with a \gls{rf} pulse of duration $\tau_{RF}$, which is swept as part of the experiment. After the \gls{rf} exposure, we then map the nucleus state back onto an electron using another \gls{mw} pulse, followed by a readout of the electron state. We perform 20 repeated measures of the nuclear state via the electron in this manner.
	
	As we vary $\tau_{RF}$, we observe that the expected value of the nuclear-spin readout, via the electron readout, follows a sinusoid with a frequency known as the Rabi frequency. Arbitrary rotations are a key part of a quantum system, and naturally improving the initialisation fidelity can allow for finer rotations.

		\label{fig::nuclear_rabi}
	\end{figure}
	
	If we have poor initialisation, this will affect the fidelity of our readout and would reduce the height of the peaks, as shown by the maximum of the fitted sinewave reaching only 92.4\% without intialisation, compared to 99.4\% with intialisation.

\subsection{Initialisation Level Tuning}
	The initialisation level of the pulse sequence was tuned to find the best position for a high fidelity experiment. It was discovered, however, that with initialisation there was a broad (approximately 400 mV) flat-band in which high fidelity results were obtained. This indicates another benefit in performing electron initialisation, which is insensitivity to tuning. This is a very useful property for a quantum computer, as reproducibility of measurements is crucial in determining the result of a computation.

	\end{figure}
	
	Another novel application of this measurement is that we can infer the donor temperature from the width of the flat-band. The flat-band itself is a measure of the tail reading from the Zeeman splitting of the electron donor, assuming finite temperature.
